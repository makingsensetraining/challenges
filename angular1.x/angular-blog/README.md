The challenge is simple:

Create a minimal expression (from your perspective) of a blog platform.
You have up to 72hs to deliver the finished challenge.

Everything will be evaluated, technical and non-technical skills. Show us what you've got!

Tip: if you don't know something make your best guess or assumption, we want to know how you think.

May the code be with you.
